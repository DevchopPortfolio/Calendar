# Calendar
A website I made in HTML, CSS and Javascript that procedurally generates a 1 year calendar. The user can input settings and type notes into each day.

### User Experience

First the user can make some selections in the options page:
- on which day of the week the calendar's year starts (1st Jan)
- whether or not it's a leap year
- favourite day of the year

Then the calendar is procedurally generated and the browser navigates to it. The calendar is a grid that fills the browser window. Weekdays are columns and months are rows.

Each day of the calendar is a grid 'cell' that has:
- a number indicating the date
- space for user's notes
- a colour determined by to its month

The user can click on any day cell and type notes into that day. If they enter more text than is able to fit, a vertical scroll bar appears on the cell.

Details of the currently selected day are given in the info bar at the bottom of the window.

The 'favourite day' cell is automatically labelled.

### Concepts

Written in HTML, CSS and javascript.

An app that solves a problem by using an algorithm.

Javscript interacts with the DOM to procedurally build an HTML document and create a web page.

HTML forms (text input, selection menu, date selector) take user input.

HTML attributes pass user input data from the HTML form to javascript.

The javascript sessionStorage Class transfers data between webpages.

Javascript reads the values of CSS custom properties.

A 'for loop' creates a series of JS objects.

A function call located inside a loop to invoke a function multiple times, passing different arguments each time.

Javascript's DOM utilities copy, modify and insert elements to the web page.

Data attributes store meta data in HTML elements.

An event listener detects the user's mouse clicks.

Keyboard focus is detected and controlled.

Page layout is controlled by CSS box model, flexbox and grid.

CSS grid controls the layout of hundreds of HTML elements.
